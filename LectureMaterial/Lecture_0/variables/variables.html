<!-- To not have redundancy as shown in variables.css we use scss which allows us to have
variables in ccss(it is an extension of css). The scss file however cannot be linked using
the link operator in html. It must first be compiled to a css file (here variables0). The
compilation is done using the scss programm. To not have to compile it by handw we can use
the watch command, such that it gets compiled automatically if a change is noticed-->
