# Learning objectives

This course picks up where Harvard University's CS50 leaves off, diving more deeply into the design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Flask, Django, and Bootstrap. Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience. Through hands-on projects, students learn to write and use APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku. By course's end, students emerge with knowledge and experience in principles, languages, and tools that empower them to design and deploy applications on the Internet.

## Overview:

This repository contains a total of **5 Projects**, each accompanied by its **own readme file** which describes what was done in detail and **sample images** to see what the end result looks like without installing. The following projects (ordered in terms of a mix between complexity and maturity):
- Project 5 (Final Project): Design a education website similar to edX.org 
- Project 4: Design a Twitter-like social network website for making posts and following users.
- Project 2: Design an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that will allow users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a watchlist.
- Project 3: Design a front-end for an email client that makes API calls to send and receive emails.
- Project 1: Design a Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia.
- Project 0 (warm-up): Design a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.

**Note:** 
- I have started this course with 0 prior knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javscript, Bootstrap and Django.
- Complexity increases from Project to Project. (Project 0 is more of a warm-up)
