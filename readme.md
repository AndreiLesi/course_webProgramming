# Learning objectives

This course picks up where Harvard University's CS50 leaves off, diving more deeply into the design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Flask, Django, and Bootstrap. Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience. Through hands-on projects, students learn to write and use APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku. By course's end, students emerge with knowledge and experience in principles, languages, and tools that empower them to design and deploy applications on the Internet.

**Note:** 
- I have started this course with 0 prior knowledge into HTML and CSS
- Complexity increases from Project to Project. (Project 0 is more of a warm-up)
