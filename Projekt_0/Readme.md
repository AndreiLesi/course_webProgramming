# Projekt 0: Search 
Design a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.

## Specification

Your website must meet the following requirements.

* **Pages**. Your website should have at least three pages: one for Google Search, one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search.
    * On the Google Search page, there should be links in the upper-right of the page to go to Image Search or Advanced Search. On each of the other two pages, there should be a link in the upper-right to go back to Google Search.
* **Query Text.** On the Google Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click â€œGoogle Searchâ€, and be taken to the Google search results for that page.
    * Like Googleâ€™s own, your search bar should be centered with rounded corners. The search button should also be centered, and should be beneath the search bar.
* **Query Images.** On the Google Image Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.
* **Query Advanced.** On the Google Advanced Search page, the user should be able to provide input for the following four fields (taken from Googleâ€™s own advanced search options)
    * Find pages withâ€¦ â€œall these words:â€
    * Find pages withâ€¦ â€œthis exact word or phrase:â€
    * Find pages withâ€¦ â€œany of these words:â€
    * Find pages withâ€¦ â€œnone of these words:â€
* **Appearance.** Like Googleâ€™s own Advanced Search page, the four options should be stacked vertically, and all of the text fields should be left aligned.
        Consistent with Googleâ€™s own CSS, the â€œAdvanced Searchâ€ button should be blue with white text. When the â€œAdvanced Searchâ€ button is clicked, the user should be taken to search results page for their given query.
* **Lucky**. Add an â€œIâ€™m Feeling Luckyâ€ button to the main Google Search page. Consistent with Googleâ€™s own behavior, clicking this link should take users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.
* **Aesthetics.** The CSS you write should match Googleâ€™s own aesthetics as best as possible.
