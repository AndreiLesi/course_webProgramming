# Project 5: Education Website.  

Designing and implementing a web application of your own with Python and JavaScript. For this project i have chosen to design an education website, similar to edX.org 

Note: I have decided to incorporate a template this time so keep that in mind!


# Specification

In this project, you are asked to build a web application of your own. The nature of the application is up to you, subject to a few requirements:

- Your web application must be sufficiently distinct from the other projects in this course (and, in addition, may not be based on the old CS50W Pizza project), and more complex than those.
- Your web application must utilize Django (including at least one model) on the back-end and JavaScript on the front-end.
- Your web application must be mobile-responsive.
- In a README.md in your project’s main directory, include a short writeup describing your project, what’s contained in each file you created, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project. This file should also provide your justification for why you believe your project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements, mentioned above.
- If you’ve added any Python packages that need to be installed in order to run your web application, be sure to add them to a requirements.txt file!

Beyond these requirements, the design, look, and feel of the website are up to you!

# How to load the Projects:

To start the project open a console terminal in the main folder (where manage.py is located) and run :

    python mange.py runserver

To view the page go to:

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/      

Note: Make sure all required packages are available in your Python environment (a list of those requirements will be added here shortly).

## How to use site:
Use it like a education (i.e. edX.org) account. Create a account, browse courses, rate them, comment on them, enroll in them etc.
